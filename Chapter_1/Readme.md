**Day 1: Golang Introduction & Setup (30 Minutes)**

**Overall Objective:**
*   Understand what Go is, its key characteristics, and its relevance to cybersecurity.
*   Successfully install Go and configure the basic environment.
*   Write, compile, and run a "Hello, World!" program.

**Materials/Prerequisites
*   Go installed on your machine for live demo.
*   Link to Go downloads page: `https://golang.org/dl/`
*   A simple "Hello, World!" Go program ready to share/type.
*   List of example Go-based cyber tools.


    *   **What is Go?**
        *   "Go, also known as Golang, was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson (some of the legends behind Unix and C)."
        *   "It's an **open-source, statically-typed, compiled programming language**."
            *   *Statically-typed:* Types are checked at compile time, catching many errors early.
            *   *Compiled:* Code is converted directly to machine code, making it fast.
        *   "It's designed to be **simple, efficient, and reliable** for building modern software."
    *   **Key Characteristics & Design Philosophy:**
        *   **Simplicity & Readability:** "Go has a relatively small syntax, making it easier to learn and read than some other languages. The focus is on clarity."
        *   **Concurrency:** "One of Go's superpowers! It has built-in features (goroutines and channels) that make it very easy to write programs that do many things at once. Hugely beneficial for performance."
        *   **Garbage Collection:** "Handles memory management automatically, reducing common bugs like memory leaks."
        *   **Fast Compilation:** "Even large projects compile quickly, speeding up development."
        *   **Strong Standard Library:** "Comes with a rich set of built-in packages for common tasks (networking, file I/O, etc.)."
    *   **Why Go for Cybersecurity (Recap/Integration):**
        *   "So, how does this all tie into cybersecurity?"
        *   **Performance:** "Great for scanners, parsers, and tools that need speed."
        *   **Concurrency:** "Perfect for tasks like scanning multiple ports/hosts simultaneously."
        *   **Static Binaries:** "Compile your tool into a single executable file with no dependencies. Easy to deploy on target systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) â€“ just copy and run. Fantastic for IR or pentesting tools."
        *   **Cross-Compilation:** "Easily build for different operating systems from one machine."
        *   **Networking Prowess:** "Its standard library is excellent for building network tools."
        *   **Growing Ecosystem:** "Many modern cyber tools are written in Go."

**(8-10 Minutes) Cyber Link: Real-World Go Tools (2 mins)**
*   **You say:** "To make this concrete, here are some well-known cybersecurity tools built with Go:"
    *   **Nuclei:** "Fast, template-based vulnerability scanner."
    *   **GoPhish:** "Open-source phishing toolkit."
    *   **Terraform/Docker/Kubernetes:** "Infrastructure tools often written in Go; understanding Go helps secure them."
    *   **Others:** Subfinder, httpx, ffuf, Aquatone. "Being able to read their source code is a huge advantage."

**(10-25 Minutes) Setup & First Program (15 mins)**
*   **You guide:**
    *   **1. Go Installation:**
        *   "Okay, let's get Go installed. Head over to `https://golang.org/dl/`."
        *   "Pick the installer for your OS (Windows `.msi`, macOS `.pkg`). For Linux, you can use the tarball or your package manager."
        *   *Give them a few minutes. Offer assistance.*
    *   **2. Verify Installation:**
        *   "Once installed, open a *new* terminal or command prompt."
        *   "Type `go version` and hit Enter. You should see something like `go version go1.2X.Y os/arch`."
        *   *Troubleshoot if needed (PATH issues are common if not using an installer).*
    *   **3. Development Environment - Keep it Simple Today:**
        *   **Text Editor:** "For today, any simple text editor is fine: Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or something like VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++. We're not setting up a full IDE today, just focusing on the basics."
        *   **Go Workspace - Brief Overview (GOPATH vs. Modules):**
            *   "You might hear about `GOPATH`. Historically, Go had a strict workspace where all your Go code and downloaded libraries lived. It could be a bit rigid."
            *   "The modern way is using **Go Modules**. This allows projects to live *anywhere* on your computer and manage their own dependencies. It's much more flexible."
            *   "For today, we'll keep it super simple. We'll create a folder for our `hello.go` file, and `go run` will work without needing to formally initialize a module. We'll cover `go mod init` when we start building bigger projects or using external libraries."
    *   **4. Create Project Folder & File:**
        *   "Let's all create a folder, maybe `go-learning` on your Desktop or in your Documents."
        *   "In your terminal, navigate into that folder: `cd path/to/go-learning`"
        *   "Now, using your text editor, create a new file named `hello.go` inside this `go-learning` folder."
    *   **5. Write the "Hello, World!" Code:**
        *   "Type this exact code (or I can paste it in chat):"
            ```go
            package main

            import "fmt"

            func main() {
                fmt.Println("Hello, Cybersecurity Team from Go!")
            }
            ```
    *   **6. Brief Code Explanation:**
        *   `package main`: "Declares that this code will compile into an executable program."
        *   `import "fmt"`: "Brings in the 'format' package, which provides functions for formatted I/O, like printing to the console."
        *   `func main()`: "The special function where program execution begins."
        *   `fmt.Println(...)`: "A function from the `fmt` package that prints a line of text."
    *   **7. Run the Program:**
        *   "Back in your terminal (ensure you're in the `go-learning` folder)."
        *   "Type `go run hello.go` and press Enter."
        *   "You should see: `Hello, Cybersecurity Team from Go!`"
        *   **Acknowledge this success!**
    *   **8. (Optional, if time) Build the Executable:**
        *   "You can also *build* a standalone executable. Type `go build hello.go`."
        *   "Now, if you look in your folder (e.g., `ls` or `dir`), you'll see a `hello` file (or `hello.exe` on Windows). This is your compiled program! You can run it directly: `./hello` (or `hello.exe` on Windows)."
